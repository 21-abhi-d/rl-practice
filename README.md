# 🚗 Autonomous Driving with Reinforcement Learning and AI Agent Infrastructure

## 📖 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the integration of an AI Agent Infrastructure with an autonomous driving system powered by reinforcement learning (RL). The primary objective is to showcase how an external infrastructure can guide, shape, and enhance the decision-making process of an RL-driven autonomous vehicle, ensuring safety, compliance with regulations, and overall efficiency.

## 🧠 Key Components
- **Reinforcement Learning Agent:** Learns to drive through simulated urban environments using a reward-based approach.
- **AI Agent Infrastructure:** An external system that provides:
  - **Attribution:** Tracks agent actions for accountability.
  - **Interaction Shaping:** Enforces driving rules and societal norms.
  - **Harm Detection & Mitigation:** Prevents potentially dangerous actions by the autonomous vehicle.
- **Simulation Environment:** Uses a driving simulator (e.g., CARLA or OpenAI Gym) to train and test the RL agent.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The RL agent interacts with the simulation environment, learning to drive through rewards and penalties.
2. The AI Agent Infrastructure monitors these interactions, enforcing rules and overriding dangerous actions when necessary.
3. The infrastructure provides additional context, improving the efficiency of the learning process.

## 🌱 Future Enhancements
- Extend the AI Agent Infrastructure to support real-world vehicle testing.
- Integrate more complex scenarios, such as pedestrian crossings and emergency vehicle responses.
- Implement explainability features to provide insights into the decision-making process of the RL agent.
